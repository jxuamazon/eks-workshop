# Getting Started

Get familiar with the event portal

Create a online IDE for command line and coding 

Install eksctl and kubectl command line interface

Create roles and keys

## NOTES for today: Since we are sharing each AWS account with multiple people, you will need to 

1. Remember your number and use it in some resource names to avoid collision. 

2. Setup your CLUSTER_NAME environment variable with "eksworkshop-eksctl-YOUR_NUMBER" 

3. Ignore "resoruce X exists"  error when you create certain resources (cause one of your teammates have already done it).  
4.
